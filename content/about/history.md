A group of educators, students, government and industry representatives gathered in San Antonio, Texas, to discuss the feasibility and desirability of establishing regular cyber security exercises with a uniform structure for post-secondary level students.<!--more--> During their discussions this group suggested the goals of creating a uniform structure for cyber security exercises might include the following:

- Providing a template from which any educational institution can build a cyber security exercise
- Providing enough structure to allow for competition among schools, regardless of size or resources
- Motivating more educational institutions to offer students an opportunity to gain practical experience in information assurance

The CCDC is unique in that it focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing network infrastructure. While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing "commercial" network. Teams are scored based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.
