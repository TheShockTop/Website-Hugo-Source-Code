# What is CCDC?
CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition) is a two day competition event that specifically focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing "commercial" network infrastructure. Not only do students obtain the opportunity to test their knowledge in an operational environment, but also get the chance to experience real-time incident response.

# What about WRCCDC?

The entirety of CCDC is split into 10 regions. We are the Western Regional. Each region sends their first place winners to compete at Nationals, where each team battles it out for champion. Due to the number of universities and colleges that get to participate, each region may operate differently in terms of how they get to select which teams get to compete at their regional.

# What is the typical structure of the competition?
For us, we hold multiple, online, introductory rounds to allow new and returning teams to *"test the waters"*. We call these the **Invitationals**. Once the Invitationals are over, we hold an online qualifying round known as **Qualifiers** where we filter out the 10 best teams that will eventually compete at our in-person, real-time, regional round known as **Regionals**. Due to the number of schools that participate in our region, as well as the capacity of our IT infrastructure, we implemented this qualifying round to make everyone's experience as fair and enjoyable as possible. The first place winners at Regionals get sent to compete at **Nationals**.
<br>**TL;DR: Invitationals > Qualifiers > Western Regionals > Nationals.**

# What should I expect when I compete?
You have just been hired as the network and security administrators at a small company and will be taking administrative control of all information systems. You know very little about the network, what security level has been maintained, or what software has been installed. You have one hour to familiarize yourself with the network and systems and to begin the security updates and patches before the red team starts actively attacking your company, you must also have to keep up with the needs of the business and user demands while maintaining service level agreements for all critical Internet services.

# Where can I learn more?
The first thing we can recommend is to check with your local college/university/school club directory to see if there is already an established club or organization that is registered for the competition. If you are a new school that has never competed before, check out the links below, including the rules to see if your team and/or school is eligible to play. If you are a company that would like to get involved through a sponsorship, please click on the link and head over to our sponsorship page.
